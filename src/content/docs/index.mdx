## What is Q-Store?

Q-Store is a revolutionary quantum-native database and machine learning framework that seamlessly integrates quantum computing capabilities with classical machine learning workflows. It enables developers and researchers to leverage quantum hardware (IonQ, IBM Quantum, etc.) and high-performance simulators for real-world ML applications without requiring deep quantum physics expertise.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional quantum ML frameworks face critical challenges:

- 🐌 **Performance Bottlenecks**: Sequential circuit submission causes 10-100x slower training
- 🔧 **Complexity Barrier**: Steep learning curve requiring quantum physics expertise
- 🔌 **Hardware Lock-in**: Tight coupling to specific quantum providers
- 💾 **Data Management**: No production-ready storage for quantum ML training
- 🎯 **Classical Overhead**: 100% CPU/GPU computation
